  Text: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
    The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics

  HardText: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
    The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics
    most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic
    outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy
    draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.
